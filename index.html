            <p id="p-id-about-me">A restaurant is generally an establishment where the public may obtain meals or
                refreshments. The term Restaurant has its origins in Paris, where one A. Boulanger started as a soup
                vendor in 1765. A sign on the door said “restaurant”, referring to the restorative quality of the soups
                and broths served within.

            <h1><span class="span-gray-text">My Recipies</span></h1>
            <p id="p-id-recipies">This site will consider recipes through the ages, ranging from medieval alchemical
                recipes to twentieth-century jellied salads. The blog is connected to a larger crowd-sourcing project
                (hosted at the University of Saskatchewan, but with collaborators from Germany, the U.K., and the U.S.)
                to transcribe recipe books, beginning with some of the seventeenth-century ones that have been digitized
                at the Wellcome Library, London. The project’s crowd-sourcing website and software are still in
                development, but we hope to make them public in the autumn 2012. We plan for the website to be a portal
                to several recipe-related projects. We are working towards, ultimately, extracting data from the
                transcriptions to trace recipes and ingredients over time and place.
